## Concepts
Main concepts of this framework

### Routes
Every folder or file created inside the folder pages will become a route, unless the name starts with _. Eg: a file named search.tsx will become a route /search and a file named products.tsx inside a folder named catalog (pages/catalog/products.tsx) can be accessed at /catalog/products.

#### Dynamic Routing
You can access a dynamic route by naming the file as [].tsx. If you type a name inside the [], you can access this information via router.

## Extra
### Styled Components
In order to use styled-components you have to create a babel.config.js filem configurate it, install the plugin `babel-plugin-styled-components` and create a file _document.tsx inside the pages folder.

The _document.tsx file pre-loads all the styles that were generated by the pre-loading of some page and when the node server shows the page it will show with some styles and not just only the html.
